package access

// Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization model that evaluates attributes (or characteristics), rather than roles, to determine access.
// The purpose of ABAC is to protect objects such as data, network devices, and IT resources from unauthorized users and actions—those that
// don’t have “approved” characteristics as defined by an organization’s security policies.
